# dalsa-build

This repo helps building [Teledyne DALSA](https://www.teledynedalsa.com)
[GigE-V Linux SDK](https://www.teledynedalsa.com/en/products/imaging/vision-software/linux-gige-v-framework/)
for GenICam cameras.

For licensing issue, the SDK cannot distributed, but if you have a copy of it,
you can use this image as a base for building your own Docker images.
